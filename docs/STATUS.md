# HomeStack Project Status

## Current Status

HomeStack is currently in active development with core functionality fully implemented and operational. The CLI is functional for scanning Docker containers, Unraid servers, and pfSense routers, as well as generating various configuration files.

The project has been successfully upgraded to .NET 9.0.

## Completed

### Core Functionality
- âœ… Basic project structure created with proper modularization 
- âœ… Core interfaces defined for Docker, Unraid, and pfSense scanners
- âœ… Data models defined for all key components
- âœ… Template-based configuration generator
- âœ… Build system fully functional with .NET 9.0

### Docker Integration
- âœ… Scanner for Docker containers
- âœ… Detection of container health
- âœ… VPN isolation detection
- âœ… Container port mapping

### Unraid Integration  
- âœ… Scanner for Unraid servers via SSH
- âœ… System information retrieval
- âœ… Docker container discovery on Unraid

### pfSense Integration
- âœ… Scanner for pfSense routers via SSH
- âœ… DNS host override retrieval
- âœ… DHCP lease retrieval
- âœ… Interface information retrieval

### Configuration Generation
- âœ… pfSense DNS host override generation 
- âœ… Nginx reverse proxy configuration generation
- âœ… Caddy reverse proxy configuration generation
- âœ… Flame dashboard bookmark generation
- âœ… Homepage dashboard service generation

### CLI
- âœ… Command-line interface for scanning
- âœ… Command-line interface for configuration generation
- âœ… JSON output for scan results
- âœ… Configuration output to files
- âœ… Upgraded to .NET 9.0 for latest features and performance improvements

## In Progress
